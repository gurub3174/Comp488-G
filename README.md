# Comp488-G
Zillow Project for Comp 488


* The Python file I added has imports (if you check the imports ive added an option to just use the combined csv, if you opt to use this you can skip past the 'Data Cleaning' dropdown and start from there)
* Data Standardization dropdown essentially just picks the numerical columns we will likely want to explore (the rest are probably not useful for any of our potential business ideas, or to create graphical insights). These columns are then imputated using Kmeans, I would recommend using the Cleaned_combined_zillow df that is created from this step for any visualizations and EDA you would like to do.
* Feel free to check out the visualizations I have in the notebook, most were just made for me to guage how the data feels, and compare them to some macro trends, or see if there are any correlated numerical columns (ex. Price and Zestimate).
* The rest of the Notebook is a work in a progress (I havent had the opportuntiy to look through the categorical variables of the combined zillow df), If someone could look into these and identify (and potentially imputate/encode) any relevant columns after we decide a business topic that would be amazing. 
*  Feature selection and target variable creation can only be done once we figure out a business topic.
